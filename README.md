# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kaif Shariff

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology, and here's a little about me:

-  I'm constantly learning and improving my programming skills, including JavaScript, Java, and using tailwind CSS for web development.
-  I've worked in all the major platforms (Mobile, Web, Desktop).
-  Made projects in React, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, ASP & VB.NET, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Python (Flask) and  SQL
-  I hold a Hackerrank SQL (basic) certificate, and I'm proud to have earned a gold medal for Java and a silver medal for SQL on Hackerrank.
